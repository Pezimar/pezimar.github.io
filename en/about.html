						<p class="float_left">I was born May 15. the year 2000 at the National Hospital in Reykjavík 8:42am. For the first two years of my life, I lived in Reykjavík but moved to Copenhagen two years old. There I lived for 4 years, while my father was in school. When dad finally graduated, I moved to Selfoss, where I've lived since. I like it a lot here in Selfoss. But I also like travelling and especially with good friends.</p>
